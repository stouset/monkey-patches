= monkey-patches

This is a set of commonly-used extensions to Ruby core classes, implemented
using the Monkey[http://github.com/stouset/monkey] monkeypatching framework.

== Usage

The easiest way to use monkey-patches is to simply require the whole set of
patches.

  require 'monkey/patches'
  
  Monkey.patch(Array, :blank?) { [].blank? }

Alternatively, you can require patches as-needed.

  require 'monkey/patch/object/metaclass'
  
  Monkey.patch(String, :metaclass) { "foo".metaclass }
